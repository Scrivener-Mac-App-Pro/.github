## Overview

Scrivener for Mac is built around the way writers actually think, plan, and revise long projects. Instead of forcing everything into one endless document, it breaks work into manageable pieces using **[binder-based manuscript views](#)**, **[section-focused drafting](#)**, and **[split-editor comparison](#)** so context is always nearby. Authors can drag and reorder scenes with **[drag-and-drop structuring](#)**, reshaping narrative flow or argument chains without losing sight of the bigger picture. Safety nets such as **[revision-friendly snapshots](#)** invite experimentation without fear of losing earlier versions.

The app acts as a central home for both words and reference material. Notes, images, web clippings, and research live inside **[integrated research panes](#)** so that supporting information stays one click away. When a draft is ready to share, **[flexible compile presets](#)** transform the same project into manuscripts for agents, editors, printing, or digital platforms. Throughout the process, **[goal and target tracking](#)** helps writers measure progress and keep large ambitions moving forward.

For novelists, academics, screenwriters, and content teams, Scrivener for Mac offers a structured yet forgiving environment. It respects creative process while providing the organizational muscle needed for serious long-form work, making the Mac feel like a dedicated writing studio rather than just another computer.
